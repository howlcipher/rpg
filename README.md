# rpg
This is table top like rpg in Go.  I am trying to create a game in which chacters can be created via text files and loaded into the game to battle.

Phase 1: <br>
  -Make dice struct<br>
  -Dice can be sided however many is desired<br>
  -Dice can roll to generate a random number 1 to the amount of sides<br>
  
Phase 2:<br>
  -Create character attributes struct<br>
  -generate stats using created dice<br>
  
Phase 3:<br>
  -convert character struct to json<br>
  -save character struct to a text file<br>
  -convert json to strings and int<br>
  -load character<br>

Phase 4:<br>
  -Create character classes<br>
  -Classes get attribute modifiers based on type of character class (mage, fighter, etc)<br>
  
Phase 5:<br>
  -Construct user menu<br>
  
Phase 6:<br>
  -Have character simulate battle<br>
  
Phase TBA:<br>
  -More Features<br>
  -game map<br>
  -character inventory<br>
  -spells<br>
  -multi character fights<br>
